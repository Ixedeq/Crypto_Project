# Crypto_Project
CSC 414 Project

This code suite is to solve the first set of the cryptopal challenges. Coding was done by Alex, Tony, and Zo.
Each coder will describe how their contributions work.

Hex to Base64 Conversion:

The HexToBase64 function takes a hexadecimal string as input and converts it to a Base64-encoded string.
It first converts the hexadecimal input to binary and converts the binary data into Base64 format which is returned.

XOR Operation on Hex Strings:

The XORHexStrings function performs the XOR operation between two equal-length hexadecimal strings.
The result is converted back to a hexadecimal string and returned.

XOR Decryption:

The xor_decrypt function takes an array of bytes and a single-byte key to perform XOR decryption.
It XORs each byte of the ciphertext with the key and stores the result as characters in a string.
The decrypted string is returned.

Scoring English Text:

The score_english_text function is used to score a given string as English text based on the frequency of English letters.
It assigns higher scores to text that contains more common English letters.
